							Hey there! I'm Felix (fell-icks) Dulys (doo-leese) and I use he/him pronouns.

							<p>A few years ago, I helped build <strong>Simple Energy</strong> as an Energy Data Analyst, then as a Data Scientist. I also worked as a Senior Data Scientist for what it became, <a
									href="http://www.uplight.com"><strong>Uplight</strong></a>.</p>
					
							<p>I trained as an <strong>applied economist</strong> (M.Sc) at <a
									href="https://www.canr.msu.edu/afre/">Michigan State University's AFRE (agriculture, food, and resource economics) program</a> where my research focused on field experimentation, willingness to pay pricing, and bioenergy.</p>
							<p>I served 2 years & three months in the <strong>Peace Corps</strong> in rural Panama in the Sustainable Agriculture Systems program. In conjunction I worked as a National Agribusiness Coordinator leading trainings across the country.

							<p>I did an analysis for energy utilities that <a href="https://uplight.com/blog/how-covid-is-impacting-residential-energy-use-the-first-three-weeks-of-data/">predicted energy use changes in a pandemic</a>. This analysis was the first of its kind and quality. I turned it into a tool for Uplight to use throughout the pandemic with their utility customers.</p>
					
							<p>
							S. Swinton, S. Klammer and I wrote "<a href="https://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/10.1002/aepp.13067">Why Biomass Residue Is Not as Plentiful as
								It Looks:
								Case Study on Economic Supply of Logging Residues</a>," which was published in the journal of Applied Economic Perspectives and Policy in 2020. This is an open-source work available free of charge.
							</p>
							<p>
							The same group and I wrote "<a
									href="https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0961953419300352">How willing are different
									types of landowner to supply
									hardwood timber residues for bioenergy?</a>". This work was published by the journal Biomass and Bioenergy in 2019. This was published under my previous name.
							</p>

							<p>I wrote "What can we learn from 400 years of United States executions?" in <a
									href="https://towardsdatascience.com/what-we-can-learn-from-400-years-of-us-executions-a6a8f522dba">Toward
									Data Science</a> in 2019.</p>

							<p>
								In 2016, the Journal of Hunger & Environmental Nutrition published "<a href="https://www.tandfonline.com/doi/abs/10.1080/19320248.2015.1045676">Benefits, Barriers, and Challenges to University-Level Food Waste Tracking</a>," which I assisted with. This was published under my previous name.
							</p>

							<p>
								In 2013, I volunteered my spare time bought through the Peace Corps Masters International Fellowship to work on "<a
									href="https://www.worldvision.org/wp-content/uploads/ProRenda-Impact-Assessment.pdf">Raising the Incomes of
									Smallholder Farmers in the Central Highlands of Angola: A Model Project for Improving Agricultural
									Value Chains in Post-Conflict Nations</a>." This was published under my previous name. I performed a quasi-experimental propensity scoring technique in an
								attempt to salvage a field experiment that was ravaged due to a civil war. The Bill and Melinda Gates Foundation funded this project through World Vision, which was executed through <a
									href="https://www.canr.msu.edu/afre/projects/angola_world_vision_prorenda_impact_evaluation">Michigan State
									University's AFRE Department</a>.

							<p>
							I do things other than data science. Here are some projects I have recently finished: </p>
							<span class="image main"><img src="images/current-project.jpg" alt="" /></span>
							This is a collapsible dice tower prototype I've given to a friend for testing and feedback.
							<span class="image main"><img src="images/current-project2.jpg" alt="" /></span>
							I made a custom bedframe with hand-cut joints.
